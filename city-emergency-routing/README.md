# City Emergency Routing (Python)

**Academic Project – Conestoga College**

## Overview
This project is an emergency dispatch routing system designed to model:
- **Stations** using Binary Search Trees (BST)
- **Buildings** using Hash Tables
- **Districts** using Graphs

## Features
- Implements **BFS and DFS** algorithms to compute shortest paths and connected components
- Handles **invalid inputs and edge cases** in routing logic
- Verified system behavior through **custom test scenarios** simulating real-world dispatch constraints

## Notes
- Practiced implementing **core data structures and graph algorithms**
- Focused on **correctness, reliability, and edge case handling**
