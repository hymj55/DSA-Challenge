## Overview
This project is a bookstore management system that manages catalog and checkout using:
- **Doubly Linked List** for the catalog
- **Stack** for the checkout cart
- **Sorting algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort

## Features
- Structured **console interface** with input validation and error handling
- **Unit tests** to verify sorting accuracy and cart behavior under edge conditions
- Completed in **two iterations**, second version extends functionality and improves structure

## Notes
- Practiced implementing **data structures from scratch** and applying them in a small project
- Emphasis on **problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and testing**
